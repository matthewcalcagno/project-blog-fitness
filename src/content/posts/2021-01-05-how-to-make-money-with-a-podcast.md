So you're thinking of starting a podcast and want to know how to make money? The truth is, it's easier than you think. In this post I'll show you exactly what it takes to be successful and get your podcast going.

## How to Create and Sell Podcasts

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The first step in building a podcast is to come up with a theme or idea. The next step is to write the script for the show.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After that, you need to record the show and start marketing it. The key thing to remember is to keep learning new things and improving your skills and show.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Get Updates From Your Audience

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This one is probably the most important part of building a successful podcast. How do you know you're doing a good job if you don't hear from your audience? They're your customers and you want to keep them happy.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Of course, you can send emails and make phone calls and you should do all of these. But another way to hear from your audience is to run polls.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

People love polls! And you can run them without a company name or logo and promote them like crazy!

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Tell Powerful Stories

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

Just like news, entertainment has a shelf life. Entertainment will always be important but you also need something to keep people hooked. And that's why podcasts are popular: people love to hear stories about people.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Are you a new mom that's looking for some advice? Ask your audience about some things you've struggled with. Maybe it's advice for people on a diet? Or, if you're a entrepreneur, talk about problems you've experienced and your solutions.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Stories work. And when you tell your stories, you can sell something. So be creative and figure out a way to package your show. Think about what your podcast will sell and what your audience needs.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can talk about technology, marketing, or whatever you like. And you can make them personal by sharing some of your own experiences.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For example, if you talk about how hard it was to launch your business, talk about how your family helped you succeed and maybe your failures. Or if you talk about how you decided to drop out of school or your failures with dating, you can share the embarrassing stories you might want to hide.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are tons of ideas out there and you can also do a roundtable or topic with a panel of experts. Or you can bring on a guest every week and ask them a question.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## How to make money with your podcast

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now that you know how to create a successful podcast, it's time to get to the money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So you might be wondering how to make money with your podcast. First, ask your audience. What do they want? They want something. And if they don't have it, they're willing to pay for it. So figure out what they want and make it happen.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you sell an audio program, you can make money with ads. There are also native advertising, paid sponsorships, subscriptions, or affiliate sales. There are hundreds of ways to make money on a podcast.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Affiliate Marketing

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

One great way to make money from your podcast is to ask other brands to sell products on your show. If you sell a product, you can ask a friend or family member to sell the product and you'll receive a small commission when they do.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you can find a few brands you want to work with, you can make hundreds of dollars a month by offering up a special promotion.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Sponsors

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you get a sponsorship, it's going to make your podcast much more lucrative. It'll also make you a lot of money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

A sponsorship is different from an ad. In an ad, the company is just selling a product and asking you to buy it. With a sponsorship, you're getting a product from the company.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You'll put together a special program for the brand and that could mean giving them some great reviews, a special giveaway, or whatever else makes sense. The key is to make sure you're giving the company the best possible experience.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Coaching & Consulting

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Another way to make money from your podcast is to offer consultation or coaching. You can ask a guest for an interview and then offer your help to make them successful.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can help people with their day-to-day business problems or help them learn something new. For example, if you're an accountant you can help people file their taxes. Or if you're a lawyer you can help people with some legal questions.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Premium Content

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you sell the premium version of your podcast, you can make more money from each show.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

A premium version is usually a subscription, membership, or add-on. With a premium version, your audience gets extra things like bonus episodes, membership support, or access to special bonus content. All for a fee.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Public speaking

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Another way to make money from your podcast is to speak at events. People love to see you speak and you can get some interesting publicity.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can speak at conferences or retreats and talk about your industry. You can also speak to a business club or group about a topic related to your industry.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## How Much Money Do Podcasts Make?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now you know how to create a podcast and you know can make a decent amount of money from a podcast. How much money do podcasts actually make?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Well, it varies from podcaster to podcaster. But you can get up to thousands of dollars a month, or a nice chunk of change each year.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So if you have a decent-sized audience and you're good at your job, you'll get paid well. That's why you need to create a podcast that people want to hear.

<!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment-->

It doesn't matter if it's a business-focused podcast, a lifestyle podcast, or an entertainment podcast. You need to make a good impression. So first and foremost, make sure your listeners love what you have to say.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Every successful podcast takes time and dedication. You can't just sit down one day and say "Hey, let's start a podcast." You have to spend some time working on it, and it's worth it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Final Thoughts

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now that you know how to start a podcast and make money from it, you have all the tools you need to do it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Don't go out and find a new audience; instead, go out and find a new product you can sell them. Once you have a set of regular listeners, you can do your first promotions.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once you're getting some money in the bank, start promoting your podcast. Then do more promotions.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

By doing that, you'll build a great audience and start making some decent money. Your podcast is only the first step to your career.
