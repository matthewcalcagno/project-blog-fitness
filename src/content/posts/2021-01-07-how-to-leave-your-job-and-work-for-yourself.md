How to quit your job and be your own boss? You'll soon find out what it's like to both work and live in a new world, without a boss, workweeks, or pesky corporate red tape to get in the way.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You'll find out what it's like to work for yourself, make your own hours, and earn all the profits you can make. You'll also learn how to start a business, get a better job, or make more money – even in a recession – by staying out of the workplace.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It's not going to be easy, and it will require some hard work and sacrifices. It will also give you a firsthand look at what you can do if you make the move to entrepreneurship, and how much freedom you'll really have.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you're ready to quit your job and begin a life of freedom, follow these steps and you'll soon be ready to make the move to being your own boss:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 1. Re-evaluate

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is the first step of many. It's important to first identify what you actually want to do, and then figure out how you're going to make it happen.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You must first figure out what you want to do with your life. Many people stop here, because it can be overwhelming and daunting to decide what they want to do with their lives.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It may be time for a change.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Start by figuring out what's most important to you.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Is it making a certain amount of money, or is it giving back to your community, or both?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Then, decide what you really want to do. It's important to get your priorities in order.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You may have been following the path that others have set before you for so long, that you may have forgotten what your priorities really are. If you don't know what they are, you're not ready to quit your job yet.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once you've figured out what you're really looking for, then you can decide which career path you want to take.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can make your decision by asking yourself one question:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

"Would I be proud to tell my family and friends that I have a job that makes my proud?"

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once you've determined that, you'll know what path to take.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 2. Find a solution

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Many people who want to leave their job decide they don't have the skillset to make the move. If this is you, you may want to consider taking online courses.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are many amazing online colleges, companies, and companies that offer online certification courses. It's never been easier to get a college degree online.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are many courses that could help you develop the skills you need to become an entrepreneur, such as:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

* Marketing
* Accounting
* Technical skills
* Business development

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 3. Tell your boss

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This step is crucial. It's time to get your plan of action approved.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You need to let your current boss know you plan on leaving your job, and then make sure your benefits are still in place and are up-to-date.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Then, you'll need to fill out the proper paperwork, and return any necessary paperwork to your HR department, so that your resignation is official.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you've been thinking of leaving for awhile, but haven't gone ahead and told your boss, this is your chance to do so.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If your boss wants to keep you around, or if they have ideas for where to take your career, then you'll need to have a "come to Jesus" moment.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You'll need to explain that you want to leave, but you will be willing to work around them, should they want to continue your job.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Tell them you understand the job you're leaving now is important to them, but that you feel you're moving in a new direction and it's time for you to step aside.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If this doesn't go over well, then it might be time to re-think your relationship with your boss.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 4. Fulfill the desire

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You're now in the stage of following your passion, where you can truly be your own boss.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

In this stage, you need to determine what the most fulfilling job would be for you, and then figure out how you can make that happen.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Maybe you've always wanted to own a restaurant, but have never found the time to do it. This is the time to figure it out, and start working on your business plan.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

What resources would you need to get started, such as:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

* Investment money
* A location to do your work
* Cooking utensils and equipment
* Seeting up your website

<!--StartFragment-->

This is the stage where you need to identify what's important to you and your personal goals, and then focus on those things.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 5. Determine when you'll do it

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It's now time to decide when you'll do it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you've chosen to make a career change, then you've set a target date for when you will leave your job.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You'll need to consider the different financial, personal, and social factors involved in making your decision.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you have children, the most important thing is to make sure your family is on board. Children are a huge source of stress on most parents, and starting a business is no different.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you have children, you need to ensure you have the support and understanding of your spouse, especially if you plan on doing it alone.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you don't plan to have children, you'll need to ensure you're financially stable and prepared to live on a single income, if need be.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Lastly, if you can stay employed, then you can continue to work while you pursue your dream. This could be a big advantage to you, as you'll have plenty of built-in support from your current employer.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 6. Define the definition of success

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You now have a new destination in mind. You now know what your destination is, so you have to determine the definition of success.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is the most important step, as you need to determine how your life is going to change.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

How will you define success? Will you need to have a steady income from your new venture? Will you need to have a new business vehicle?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you are planning on becoming a freelancer, for example, then you'll need to figure out the rules of engagement. Will you have to buy a specific type of computer or laptop?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Will you have to invest in a piece of equipment to get started? Do you need to buy equipment for marketing purposes?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

How long do you have to build up your business before you can start making any money?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

These are just a few of the questions you'll need to answer.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## 7. Begin thinking about how you will fund your dream

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you are planning on starting a business, then you'll need to know how you will fund it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is an important decision to make, as it'll affect everything you need to do after you leave your job.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Even if you choose to remain employed, you're still considering making a career change.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You need to make sure that you will be able to live on a single income. Do you have the funds available to be able to pay the bills?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you have family members to support you, that's great. But you'll still need to figure out how you're going to pay the bills.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

How much of your savings will you need to sustain you during this time?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you have a financial safety net, you will be able to live a financially independent lifestyle. But if you don't have this, you will need to start putting aside some money each month, to help you through this.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This money can be invested in the market or saved up until you're ready to take the leap.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After all of these questions have been answered, it's time to sit down with your banker and see if you qualify for a loan.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Final Thoughts

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Fully developing your dream is the first step to success. You may have to make some changes along the way, but once you decide what you want to do with your life, you'll know exactly what steps you have to take to achieve it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you want to become an entrepreneur, make your dream a reality.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Become an entrepreneur and you'll soon realize that your dreams can come true. It's time to put your thinking cap on and start working on those projects that you've been putting off.
