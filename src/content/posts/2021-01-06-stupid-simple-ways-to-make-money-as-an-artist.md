## Sell art on Instagram

I’m sure that you’ve heard about this by now, but Instagram is a really great place to sell art!

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

As an artist, you can easily make money by selling pieces on Instagram with great results.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can find people who are interested in what you do, and you can ask them to buy your art right on Instagram itself.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

One of the easiest ways to sell your artwork online is to sell prints and posters. These are the perfect opportunities to get your work in front of as many people as possible.

<!--StartFragment-->

Instagram’s really simple interface means you can promote your art as well as just tag it in a post.

## Teaching art online

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you want to do something that’s a little more involved than just posting artwork on Instagram, you can also teach art online.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It’s easy to find people who are interested in learning about drawing, and by offering to teach them, you can reach a huge audience.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

An ideal place to teach online is video courses, since these tend to be really popular online.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can make passive income with courses on top of your income from doing artwork!

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

A great thing about teaching online is that you can do it from anywhere in the world, and you don’t even need an expensive setup to do it. All you need is a webcam and a microphone.

## Start a blog about art

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

To be able to make a lot of money selling artwork online, you need to have a blog about your art. I can’t stress this enough.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Art blogs can help your business spread, and you can even turn it into a career, making money doing what you love.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are loads of great opportunities to make money by starting your own art blog, but there are two things you need to keep in mind when you’re starting your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

First, you need to create a blog with a huge following. You want people to visit your blog often, so you have to keep it updated with new content.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Second, you need to write a lot of great content, since people are going to be searching for it all over the internet. This is why it’s so important to create great content that people want to read.

They report having sold hundreds of dollars’ worth of artwork in a single month, which is really impressive!

## YouTube art tutorials

<!--StartFragment-->

YouTube is one of the most popular websites in the world, and it’s a great platform for selling videos on how to do anything.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I know a couple of people who have already made money with these videos, and you can create your own as well if you’re interested in doing so.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There’s also a good chance you’ll find people who are really interested in what you’re doing!

<!--EndFragment-->

## Become a Freelancer artist

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Basically, being a freelance artist means you do art on your own time. Instead of working full time, you do art work on your own schedule.

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

This means that you get to do what you want when you want to do it. You can work on your own schedule, and you can make money doing what you love.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

All you have to do is create and market your art, and you’ll be making money while doing it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The best part about this is that you can do it from anywhere in the world. You don’t need to be in the same place to do what you love. You can do what you love in your pajamas!

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Plus, there are tons of websites that are great for freelancing, so you can start off in the right place.
