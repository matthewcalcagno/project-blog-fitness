## Getting started

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So what do you need to start a small online business? A few things really. You need a domain. You need to create a design for the website. And most importantly you need to choose a business plan. You will find that your business plan is going to be the hardest part of your business to get up and running. It is your main business guide, it is your “business bible” that will keep your business on the road. But if you are serious about having your own business, you need to find a small business plan that will work for you. Our small business plans can help you turn your vision into a profitable business.

You will also need a website. If you want a true online business you will need a website. And a domain name. And it will need to be customized to match your business goals and branding. If you are on a budget, you will want a free or inexpensive website. If you want something professional and beautiful, you will want to pay a little more to get something professional and beautiful. And it will need to be optimized to get the most visitors to your website.

<!--StartFragment-->

Let’s not forget what tools you will need. If you have a background in graphic design you will probably find that you are ready to use one or all of the design tools that are available. If you are not familiar with design and logos, you will need some tutorials on that as well. We are going to focus on the front end of your website and tools that will help you build a robust eCommerce store.

In addition to the tools above, you will need access to some money. If you are self-employed and you have bills to pay, this means you will need to have a business bank account and cash. And it will probably take time to get started. If you are starting a business that does not generate income until after you have turned a profit, then you are in luck. That means you can probably get started with very little money.

If you have a partner or family you can hire to help you get started, but they will have different needs than you do.

## Work on SEO

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your website will need to be SEO optimized. Most people find the first few pages of Google useful, and then click down to the home page. That means your website has to be relevant to those first few pages. That means that when someone searches for a keyword that is related to your website, you will want your website to come up in that search. But you also want to be up near the top of search results, which means you want a top page ranking. That means you will want to write great content, or find someone else to write great content for you. You want people to see your website and experience your website before they click “buy” or “log in.”

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will also want to do some SEO on social media. People buy a lot of things through social media, and you need to be on those platforms to get your name out. If you do not have Facebook pages, you need to start one. And it will be easy if you do.

## Find the right small business plan

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are many different types of small business plans out there. Your small business plan will include marketing, the size and scope of your operations, financing, expansion options and other important parts of your business plan. We think it is important that you find a plan that will work for you. We will describe the different plans below. We think you need a plan that covers your time frames. A plan that is suitable for you and your small business. If you have a more long-term vision, or if you have more revenues to budget for, then you need a plan that will support that vision.

## Small business startup costs

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The first step in any small business is to get started with the money. You will need a small business loan to get started with. Most banks will give you access to your money with a small business loan. You need the money from a bank because you don’t have enough to get started with. And you need to find a bank that will loan you the money because if you do not find a bank that will give you the loan, then you will need to get a loan from a family member or friend. That is not a good solution because it may not be the right amount of money for you, and you will likely need to give a large portion of the money back.

## Setting up a small business bank account

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will need a small business bank account. The reasons you need this account is that your bank will provide your credit and debit cards. You will be able to send and receive money to your business account as well. You will need an account because it will make it easier for you to track your finances, including your cash flow, and you will be able to run a more efficient business. But make sure that your business bank account has no fees. You will need to pay fees for everything from debit cards to taxes on interest income. Make sure you are aware of all of your account fees before you make the decision to open an account. And make sure that your small business bank account does not have high minimum balances. If you have a high minimum balance, you will likely need to pay a fee if you pay by debit card.

## Security

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will want to keep your company’s information safe when it is online. Your website will be used by customers, and you want it to be secure. Keep the password to your website private. Don’t make your password the same as your email address or another place where you post your details. Also, never reuse the same password for different websites. Don’t forget to protect the site you are using from hackers. Make sure the security software on your website is up to date. And look for an up-to-date and secure internet browser, like Google Chrome.. Don’t try to connect to the site when the browser is not updated. And if you are using a hosting company, make sure you are aware of the security policies and practices. If you use shared hosting, make sure you change the default username and password that you have assigned to the account.

## Bookkeeping software

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will need a good bookkeeping software so you can keep your finances organized. However, your accounting software will not make it easy for you to complete your business transactions quickly. Make sure you have a feature called “board” or “link” buttons so you can enter the same data in multiple places. And make sure you have a feature to sync your data from your accounting software to your online payments system. And make sure you know how to add data to the cloud.

## Know your business cash flow

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will want to be aware of all of the cash flow from your business. Make sure you have the ability to convert cash to your accounting software quickly. The fastest way to convert cash is via bank wire transfers. And if you are not already using a wire transfer system, make sure you understand how to go about doing this. You can also use an escrow system, and some services even allow you to specify a specific amount you want to deposit. Sometimes, however, you will have to use other methods. For example, if you have clients who pay you in cash, you will have to charge a transaction fee. Keep in mind, too, that you will need to create cash tracking records so you can track sales, purchases and withdrawals. And make sure you have a separate account for your accounting software so that you can categorize cash inflows and outflows.

## Budgeting software

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You will need a budgeting software to help you know exactly how much money you are making and how much you are spending. But even if you have a budgeting software, you will still need to know how much your business costs. Keep in mind, too, that you can spend more than you make, and you might spend more if you buy new equipment. Make sure that you have an online calculator that can help you estimate how much money you will need to make in order to keep your business afloat.

## Collateral and borrowing

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For small businesses, borrowing money is one of the most important things you can do to grow your business. However, you may have to borrow more than you want to borrow to start your business. Keep in mind that you will need to pay taxes and government fees on the loans you take out. And you can’t get into debt for any other reason than to start or grow your business. It is critical for you to do your research on any potential lenders before you decide to take out a loan. And even then, you want to make sure that you understand the rules and requirements of the lender before you start a loan.

## Taxes

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The amount of income tax you have to pay depends on your business type, location, size and other factors. Some small businesses have a low income tax rate, while others might have a high income tax rate. Small businesses have to pay income tax in a number of ways. First, they will pay income tax when they have earned enough money to be considered a taxable business. Then, they will pay taxes based on their profit, and they will pay taxes based on their income level. You can avoid paying a high tax rate by getting a job that is related to your business. And you can reduce your tax rate by keeping your business lean.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

One of the most important things you can do to keep your business running is to invest in your business. You can make sure that you have the proper financing, the right equipment and software and even the right employees. And it is important to do research before you invest, so that you know what the tax implications will be.
