You don't have to be a financial expert to be financially secure. A little planning every month will get you started on the right track. Adopt these seven habits of the financially savvy and you'll become smarter with every dollar.

A study published by the Journal of Marketing Research found that the first step to financial stability is to try to put things in perspective. You may be a millionaire but until you’ve passed the $1 million dollar mark, you have no idea how wealthy you genuinely are. If you’ve reached a point where you can understand your net worth, you don’t need to know how much Elon Musk or Bill Gates earn to know you can comfortably afford higher living standards.

Carrying around a picture of what your net worth would look like if you worked hard every day and saved every dollar is an image in itself. It is like looking at the world from the petri dish of your potential. As with any image, the more data you have, the more accurate it is but it also prevents you from getting an inaccurate picture. A large part of personal finance involves understanding your net worth and comparing it to your goals.

If you have a calculated and realistic approach, more power to you. However, if you are alcoholics or gambling addicts, it’s natural to base your financial success on things you can control. If you consider yourself financially secure and satisfied but have no plans for a millionaire life, then these expenses are necessary to be included in your monthly budget

I would consider groceries as essential prices you should be aware of. There are very cheap options but at a certain point, they ruin your budget. I have learned how to cook Japanese food so that I don’t necessarily have to buy the highest quality, but I did need to get used to paying more attention to the quality of products that I buy

I once paid $14 for a roll of toilet paper that should have cost $2.67. Even if you know how to fulfill your basic needs, there’s no need to spend money on things you can go without. Take some time to craft a budget to give yourself a vague idea of what you will need to make ends meet.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. It is more intelligent to use a budget to constantly evaluate the quality of your income and spending but also spend time understanding what you don’t need. Grow a personal garden instead of buying a million dollars worth of organic produce every year. In addition to your organic produce, buy decorative gifts at a thrift shop instead of spending more than the cost of the item itself.

One of the biggest mistakes that people make is assuming that much of their money is in the hands of financial institutions. When routine checking reveals there is substantial money parked in low-risk investments (such as a 401k), you’re being left with what amounts to free money. According to a Forbes article, Americans invest $3.8 trillion every year in retirement accounts. In contrast, Gen Z-ers, who are currently getting ready to have babies and want to start saving for their retirements, likely invest closer to $4 trillion.

My tendency is to start saving for retirement when I’m living on my own. Much of the time I contribute to my 401k but not always. When I start saving for retirement, it’s often a big question of “do I have enough money?” For example, I may have $200K saved but I’m worried I may need to move to a bigger home or do some substantial down payment.

I’ve learned that it does not matter how much money you have. The bigger problem is not what you have, but how much anxiety you cause. Roll with the punches and you’ll knock out a lot of debt and build wealth in the process.

The reason personal finance success stories are so compelling is that they are relatable. It’s hard to watch someone else rank in the upper echelons of their field while you sit with your $3K savings account watching the stock market tumble.

Saving for retirement and building wealth are not about how much money you have. They are about equity, which is the basis of financial stability. Michael J. Bosworth, personal finance author and financial consultant, says, “Eliminate debt. Don’t put any money on the line until you are financially secure.” Instead of relying on low-risk investments, watch for opportunities to invest in SIPC brackets, which are relatively safe but generous in the short term. Investments in these brackets could provide a foothold in your finances if you don’t feel like you can handle a larger monthly payment or are close to tapping out the money you have available for emergencies.
