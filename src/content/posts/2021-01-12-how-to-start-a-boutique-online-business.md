You can find popular brands online, and take a look at their brand values. Try to identify which brands have the qualities that you’d like to incorporate into your store’s brand.

Take a look at the brands that you like. These brands have a strong identity. Brands like Victoria’s Secret, Nike, Apple, and Macy’s have a well-developed brand that stands for something. These brands are consistent.

An important part of developing your brand’s identity is to differentiate yourself from your competitors. Remember that your online store’s identity should be unlike any other. Avoid copying a popular brand. Your customers might prefer to buy from you because you stand for something or you have a unique brand.

If you do decide to copy a popular brand, make sure you don’t copy everything about that brand.

But, make sure that you provide an online store that stands for something. If your store lacks an identity, it’s difficult to develop brand loyalty. Consumers could easily develop a negative opinion of your brand because it lacks a distinct personality.

Your brand should be straightforward, but it should also be unique. You don’t want your online store to have a generic brand because it’s easier to forget about a store that has no identity.

Decide how you want your brand to appear to consumers and how you’d like people to think of your store. For example, if your brand is "customized, online, gift ideas store” you could design your logo and banners to look like scrapbook pages.

Now that you have set up your online boutique, you need to get people to find your store and buy from you. The easiest way to do this is by using free social media services and paid advertising. Facebook and Google Ads are very powerful tools that are easy to use. Use the ads features to take your customers to your online boutique. If you have a website, you can also use SEO to help boost your site's visibility. Once you have your business up and running, you can take your customer referrals and social media followers to the next level by incorporating an opt-in program. An opt-in program will ask your customers to opt-in to get information about your business. The visitors will then get an email once a week or once a month with promotions and discounts. You can also use the free guest list feature to reach your audience on a monthly basis.  You can also take advantage of the ecommerce tools that Shopify offers.
