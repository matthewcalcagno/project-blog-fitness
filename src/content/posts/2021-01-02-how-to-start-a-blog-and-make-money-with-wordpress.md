## Why Blog and How to Start It

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

One of the biggest factors behind making money online is to become more active on the web.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

While it’s true that social media is huge, there’s still nothing as good as getting into the shoes of a regular person, and becoming the audience for them.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Especially in the age of the internet, people don’t just read your words, they get to know you. Your brand comes to life on the pages of your blog, and people get the impression that they know you.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Sure, you might get a few banner ads here and there, but there are many ways to get more traffic and make money online, which are more direct.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But don’t worry. I’m going to show you how to make money by blogging for beginners in this article.

<!--StartFragment-->

But don’t worry. I’m going to show you how to make money by blogging for beginners in this article.

<!--StartFragment-->

## Why Blog for Beginners?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

First of all, it’s quite easy to start a blog that attracts a large audience and brings you a bit of passive income every month.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

As I mentioned in the first part of this article, there are tons of ways to monetize your blog. You can sell things, promote products, host contests, share content, or any other activity that you think might be profitable.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For instance, if you have a lot of followers and you think you can offer them something useful, you can start a company where you offer free SEO services.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Think about it. It’s quite easy to find people on Google and Facebook, who want something that you’re offering, but you can’t get in touch with them.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And with a simple click of a button, you can connect with them on social media, and they can reach out to you through email.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can then offer to help them with their site or business, and make a bit of money on the side.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But if you do the work for them, they’ll never know about it, and you’ll make the process even easier.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And if your blog has a loyal following, you can offer to do some coaching on their behalf, which means that you don’t have to do anything else to make money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Many bloggers I know make money on the side by coaching online courses, writing eBooks or teaching from a website.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And some even make a full-time living doing just that.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Second of all, blogging doesn’t take up a lot of time, especially if you’re an advanced blogger.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are many posts on the internet that you can create in minutes, with some amount of work.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And of course, you’ll have to set up your website, but then you can start blogging, and if everything goes right, you can build an impressive website in no time.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And if your site has a large enough audience, you can monetize it even more, by hosting contests or selling affiliate products.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I wrote this article to show you how easy it is to start a blog, how much money you can make by blogging, and how easy it is to monetize a blog with other streams of income.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now, to get into the steps of making money from a blog, let’s look at what you need to do.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Here’s How to Start a Blog for Beginners

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

With this list of tips, you can start a blog for beginners and start making money online.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The only thing you need to do is get started.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And it’s actually really simple.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

First of all, get some idea about what you want to achieve. What do you want your blog to be about? Are you trying to write and publish a few posts a week?Write and publish every day? You need to plan your posting schedule before even creating your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Creating a Wordpress blog

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Wordpress is the most popular blog software for beginners.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It can be installed on a web hosting service, like Hostinger or GoDaddy.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Wordpress has a pretty good community. People often offer advice to beginners who start blogs.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The Wordpress forums has over 3 million users, and that’s a lot of knowledge. And the community is very supportive and helpful, so there’s a lot of support here for beginners.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## The next step is to choose a theme for your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Choosing a theme for your blog is not one of the most important decisions you need to make if you want to start making money from your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You don’t need to worry about finding the perfect theme. The most popular themes are so far Sydney, ColorMag and Neve

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Again, these aren’t your most important choices.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But, do keep in mind that your theme is going to be the “face” of your blog, so if your blog isn’t attractive, no one will read it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

That’s why I personally always go for a free theme when I start out. But there are some downsides too, like you will not have a unique style.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## What to write about

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The next decision is what kind of content you want your blog to produce.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The most important thing about having a successful blog is to post frequently, so that your audience stays interested in your site.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So, if you want your audience to read your blog regularly, you should make sure that your posts are of high quality.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The good thing is that you can learn how to create high quality content for your blog, by reading other blogs, like this one.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And now the most important part, how to monetize your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## How to make money with your blog

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you want to make money with your blog, you need to start thinking about monetizing your blog, or figuring out how to make money with it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Most bloggers try to make money in the beginning by selling affiliate links, or by using affiliate programs.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But these monetization methods are not always suitable.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

\
What I’m going to talk about in this section are different ways to make money from your blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You might even create your own money making system, by building a unique and scalable marketing system.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are two types of monetization methods, which I’m going to call, free monetization, and paid monetization.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

These two types of monetization methods are very different, so please make sure you know what you’re getting into before you start.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You’re always better off starting with free monetization, unless you’re ready to experiment and learn with paid monetization.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you don’t want to lose your readership, start with free monetization.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

\
 I always recommend the free monetization method, and leave paid monetization for a later stage.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Free monetization

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

\
The most famous way to make money from your blog is selling affiliate links.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Every day, millions of websites and blogs sell affiliate links.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

These links make people pay you a commission if they buy from your products, and that’s how you make money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are so many affiliate links, and the percentage that you earn is normally determined by where you sell your products.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But there are many different types of affiliate links.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For example, you can sell affiliate links in multiple countries, or you can sell links to high traffic websites.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Basically, affiliate links are just regular links that are already being sold to other websites.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

They make money for the websites who already own those links, and you make money when people click on your link and buy your products.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

People have always told me that they will never buy anything from a link on a blog, so I was very surprised when I saw how many people actually clicked the link and bought.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Another way you can make money from your blog is by building up your email list.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your email list is an opportunity to build a relationship with your readers, and in return, they will purchase your products.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For example, you can get your readers to do surveys, or work for your affiliate marketing program.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

People are very willing to pay to do surveys, because if they complete a survey, they will get something in return.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Here are some of the ways you can make money from your email list:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

* Giveaways
* Amazon
* A small fee to get added to an exclusive newsletter list
* Use your list to create a monthly report

  ### Paid monetization

<!--StartFragment-->

Most of the time, people will not pay for guest posts on blogs that they don’t know, because they don’t think you can earn anything from it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But this is not the case.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can get thousands of visitors to your site, just by  accepting a few guest posts to blogs that are in the same niche as you. This usually works when small bloggers want to gain popularity quickly from an already dominated blog.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For example, if you have a Wordpress plugins niche, and someone wants to sell their latest and greatest Wordpress plugin, they will pay you to allow them to guest post.

a lot of visitors.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If the person is willing to pay, you can make thousands of dollars in a single day.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once again, this is the type of revenue you can expect from your email lis

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The good thing about paid guest blogging is that you get paid just because you have a successful blog and you even get content.
