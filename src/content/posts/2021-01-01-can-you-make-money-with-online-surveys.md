An easy way to make money online is to take online surveys. You don't need to have any special skills or knowledge to start. You can easily earn a couple of hundred dollars doing as little as ten minutes per day.

While everyone is aware of how profitable surveys can be, they’re still a mystery to many. So I want to help people understand the tricks of the trade.

## What’s a survey

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Surveys are simply the act of asking questions, and most of the people taking them are really interested in the answers. Surveys come in various forms, such as text-based, audio, video, and graphics. The job of a survey is to gather data from participants, usually by asking multiple questions to a person at the same time.

For example, say you want to know why more and more couples in their 20s are living together as opposed to getting married. The best way to do this is by polling your audience with multiple questions. This will give you more data to work with.

Companies run surveys to try and learn more about their consumers so they can provide the best experience possible.

## How to make money with online surveys

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It’s really simple to make money with online surveys. All you need to do is find an online survey, go through the questions, and answer the ones you’re qualified for. Here’s how to get started.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Step 1: Find the right survey

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Find a survey that has the information you’re looking for. Let's use SurveyMonkey as an example. SurveyMonkey is a leading provider of surveys, has over 300,000 surveys available, such as your average car mileage, how much money people spend on coffee, or whether you’re single or married.

All you need to do is find a survey you’re interested in and then sign up.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Step 2: Fill out the survey

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now that you’ve signed up, you’re ready to start filling out surveys. When you sign up, SurveyMonkey will ask you for a profile, which is just your name and email. They also will ask how you like to communicate (in person, over email, on social media, etc.), the purpose of the survey (is it for the company, the government, or to become an affiliate), your age and gender.

Once you’ve filled out the questionnaire, SurveyMonkey will prompt you to enter your email address so you’ll be able to receive reminders. They won’t send you surveys unless you’re registered and given permission to access them.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Before you start filling out surveys, don’t forget to look at the privacy policy to make sure the site isn’t going to share your personal information with another company. You’ll also want to read the questions so you understand them and avoid having a bad experience.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After filling out the surveys, SurveyMonkey will send you a message notifying you that surveys are available for you to fill out.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

### Step 3: Answer the surveys

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once you start filling out surveys, take your time.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

People who are involved in surveys usually know the answers they want to give, and often, they are not interested in taking the survey at all. So don’t take more than 15 minutes per survey.

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

### Step 4: Track your surveys

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

After completing your survey, SurveyMonkey will send you an email asking to give them feedback. This means you’ll have another opportunity to rate the survey and rate the responses of other respondents. You can track your responses on an online dashboard.

<!--StartFragment-->

These surveys are free, but you will receive credit for participating. It’s important to note that surveys are anonymous, but surveys are sent in groups. So you will receive information about who took the survey in your email.

<!--EndFragment-->

## Which online surveys provider pay the most

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

PayScale's research shows that SurveyMonkey scored highest for salary, and Zendesk came in last. The study also found that SurveyMonkey was the top choice for evaluating customer service.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Kudos to SurveyMonkey for achieving top-notch results with a service that is actually free. The real question is: what has SurveyMonkey done to raise its profile as a top choice for online survey testing? They do not sell your information to third party companies. They actually care for the people who answer the surveys.

## How much money can you make with online surveys

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

While you probably won't become rich taking online surveys, it is possible to make it as a side hustle. From making little money on the side to making big money on the side. A side hustle could change your life. So, consider taking the plunge and see what happens.
