One of the easiest ways to make money online is to take surveys. There’s little more to it than signing up, filling out a profile, and giving your opinion on ads, products, services and more.

While everyone is aware of how profitable surveys can be, they’re still a mystery to many. So I wanted to help people understand the tricks of the trade.

1. What’s a survey?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Surveys, from a dictionary definition, are written items that people sign-up for in order to take part. The easiest way to understand this concept is through the example below:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now take a moment to think about your favorite social media site. In my case, it’s Reddit. What do people do there?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Aside from reading about news stories and the posts that their fellow Redditors have made, people comment on the content.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

As a result, Reddit users will often post an “Upvote” or “Downvote” for posts that they feel are the most interesting, entertaining or important.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So the next time you’re on Reddit, what is it that you’re scrolling through? Reddit is actually full of a bunch of different posts. To get to the one you’re looking for, you’ll first need to scroll through the comments. This is where most Reddit users get their daily news fix.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Now take a moment to think about how much it would cost you to spend 2-3 hours in Reddit and read the most interesting posts. You might be surprised. Most users, especially at large sites like Reddit, don’t spend much time there. And it’s almost like there’s a giant whisper box in the background of everything you see.

<!--StartFragment-->

It’s where users submit links and sometimes say something in the comments.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

So once you’ve come up with the answer, you can apply it to surveys. A survey is something you sign up for in order to get a chance to participate in it.

Companies run surveys to try and learn more about their consumers so they can provide the best experience possible.

Over a third of Americans now pay for something in order to read a blog. Surveys are becoming one of the most important ways for companies to reach their audiences. It’s also one of the most successful marketing strategies ever.

How to Earn

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Most people aren’t aware that they can generate money from surveys. But once you know how it works, it’s easy to make more money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

First, when you sign up for an ad-funded survey, you’ll likely be sent one or two offers a day. These offers may be for something specific like a product you’ve never heard of or for a company you’ve never heard of.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

That’s why, for now, I recommend you go for the survey that takes less time to complete, because you’ll likely make more money this way.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Here’s a quick breakdown of how much you can earn for each survey:

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

The Minimum $1 is for a basic survey

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

$5 will get you a premium survey

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

$10 will get you a “Super-Premium” survey (in reality, it’s not a survey)

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

$20 will get you a “Gold-Plus” survey (the highest form of premium I’m aware o

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But don’t think you have to pay all of those prices in order to get your questions answered.

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

If a question can be answered through one of the paid surveys, it’s usually just as easy to get the answer without spending any money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Here’s an example. I recently created a survey for a different web-based business, and their survey didn’t have enough questions to fill the page. So I created a free survey for my company.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After people completed the first free survey, they were then offered the premium survey. And because the premium survey didn’t have enough questions, it didn’t make sense to use.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But the result is that the company got 20 new new customers at no cost.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Here’s what a survey could look like:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The $1 survey is for a simple product or service.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The $5 survey is for a more complex product or service.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The $10 survey is for a custom solution.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The $20 survey is for the full solution.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The $20 survey is for a custom solution.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Note: I did not pay for this survey.

<!--StartFragment-->

When you use the “Ask” button, you’re often asked to create an account with that website. After creating an account, they can send you offers to get paid for surveys on their website.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can also create your own websites and generate free traffic by offering free surveys. Once a survey is closed, they’ll automatically send you a link to either their site or social network profile.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And you can also create your own surveys and have them available on your social media profiles.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This allows you to send out surveys to a wide variety of people.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The future is bright for surveys. So don’t think about it as a side job or something you can do when you’re bored.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Think of it as a long-term career you can start on your own time. It’s been shown that the average American respondent completes two surveys in a single week, and nearly one in five complete five surveys.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After all, studies show that people who participate in surveys are 1.2 times more likely to make a purchase from a company that offered them the survey.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Surveys can be a way for you to earn money while still being part of a community. So don’t put it off. Take the time to create a killer survey.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

And once you start making money, you’ll have the power to create and distribute more surveys until you can quit your day job.
