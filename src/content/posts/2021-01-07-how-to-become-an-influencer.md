Influencers are people who have a large and established presence in an area, say, the fashion world, and who can draw in new clients and customers. They can have different types of influence, such as authenticity or expertise.

<!--StartFragment-->

Influencers come in different sizes and qualities. Some are celebrities. Others are ordinary people who make their living blogging about their favorite subjects. It's a mixture of both these elements to be an influencer.

<!--StartFragment-->

But how do you become an influencer? You could start by becoming the person people call upon to contribute to a specific topic.

Building a big following and retaining your authority as an expert

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

In an era when everyone wants to have a large social following and to be heard online, it can be very hard to gain a large number of followers. It's no longer enough to simply go to a certain platform and be seen. Many social media platforms are now placing stringent limits on your ability to grow your follower count – and the influence of your social media presence is severely limited as well.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

However, you can still retain your authority and, if your authority is on a subject that's valued, gain more followers and recognition. For this, you have to be able to keep at it. Whether you want to simply gain awareness, which can lead to more followers in time, or whether you want to build a substantial audience on a platform like Instagram, it can be hard to maintain your presence for long periods.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Although there's still plenty of room to grow in popularity on Twitter, the platform's numbers have already begun to flatten. You can still build a large following, but the time will come when fewer people will follow you.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Not being willing to give your full focus and attention to any one platform

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are people, like many others, who specialize in one platform. One that stands out for them is YouTube, which, if you have a good channel, you can build a substantial following on. People need their voice heard, and most won't follow a range of topics. They'll be interested in something that they feel strongly about, and if they find someone on YouTube who says it in an interesting way, they'll listen.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But people also need to follow someone on multiple platforms if they want their voice to be heard, and be taken seriously. In my experience, it's not enough to be passionate about a few things – you need to be willing to be passionate about many things. I don't want to tell people what to follow, but I will tell you that you need to find a person or group of people you're passionate about, and then be just as

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You need to give your time to this if you want to remain relevant and to maintain your authority. If you dedicate all your attention to one platform, then it will leave little to be spent on building up a following on other platforms.

Breaking through the noise on social media

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Some social media platforms are starting to restrict your ability to grow your audience. You may not be able to increase your reach.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Take Instagram, for example. It's only recently that the platform began to place a limit on the size of your audience. This is one of the reasons I decided to take my Instagram following offline. It also started to show up in the follower counts of other users, and that started to make me feel as if my audience was growing faster than I was. This seemed wrong, so I decided to take it offline.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I think, in part, this is also a reaction to the volume of people on Instagram and how many new accounts are popping up every day. It's getting harder and harder to get seen, and so people are looking to limit their growth.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you want to be seen, you need to push yourself into places that are difficult for others. Social media is an endless game of comparisons, and it's incredibly hard to stand out when there are so many other people doing the same thing.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your own habits matter. If you spend time engaging on Twitter at the same time you've set aside time to spend on Instagram, that makes it much more difficult to grow your audience on one platform. You have to be able to show up where your audience is, and if you're spending more time on one, you'll need to show up on the other.

## Getting started in social media

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you're new to social media, I can offer some insight into how to establish yourself online and build a following. You have to have a focus. Think about the things that you're passionate about, and then be willing to spend time building those into a solid following.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But at the same time, you also need to be flexible. I can offer you some quick ideas.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Engage on a new platform – but not at the same time as others

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Find something that you're interested in, and then give it the time it needs to build up a following. By that I mean don't invest all of your time in one platform. It may not make sense at first to be trying to grow a following on an app like Twitter while also building a following on Snapchat, but as you get more comfortable on social media, the right time to diversify will emerge.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is one of the things that initially made me think I was missing out on building an audience on Snapchat, and I'm now a big believer in it. For years, it was only about Instagram, and that was it. There's a lot more to explore than just that one platform.

<!--EndFragment-->

## Create a brand identity

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Remember that even when you're spending all your time working on a single platform, it doesn't mean that you're not going to have multiple feeds. You may be the only person on your feed, but you can still be interacting with people on multiple platforms. This is a big part of what made my Instagram identity possible – it made it possible for me to have different experiences on Instagram depending on my mood.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

We can't have everything we want in one place. What we need to learn is how to mix it up. Your personality is at your core – find that, and then use it to make your online presence what you want it to be.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You may even want to experiment with multiple Instagram accounts. Creating accounts for certain pieces of content will help your audience know when to come back to you.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Get your content in front of as many people as possible

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Social media is about impressions – how many people are seeing your content. It's about sharing your work. It's about engagement.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The best way to get more impressions is to get in front of as many people as possible. It sounds really obvious, but I get a lot of clients telling me that they want to gain social media exposure, but they want to wait until they've got something to share.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The problem is that you're never going to get the same level of attention from one audience member as you would from another, and so it's easier to get a wider audience by working with social media marketing.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Build up your followings organically

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Get to know your audience, and become a part of it. When you're having a conversation with your followers, it helps them build trust in you and in your brand.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Spend time establishing your social media presence in a low-stress way, rather than in a rush. I had to learn that the hard way when I started blogging in 2008. I was worried about losing followers, getting it wrong, and not having the time to promote everything I was doing. But as my audience grew, I realized that it was actually much easier than I had expected.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Focusing on the right platforms

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Social media can get really overwhelming. It's easy to get sucked into Facebook and neglect everything else.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

In my opinion, social media marketing should be viewed as a series of tools rather than one big overarching approach. It should be approached as a piece of marketing, not something where you decide that you need to do everything at once and then feel like you haven't been doing enough.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

That's not how it works. That's not how it should work.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Like anything in life, if you try to do everything all at once, you'll never finish anything. You have to take things one at a time.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It's worth taking the time to go through a trial-and-error phase where you test various methods, and you slowly build up your experience. As I've said to clients before, social media marketing is no different to anything else. It is trial and error, and you should never treat it as a method of finding your way.
