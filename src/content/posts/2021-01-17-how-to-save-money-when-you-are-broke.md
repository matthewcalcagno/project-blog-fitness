When you’re in your twenties or thirties, the world’s financial options can seem limitless. In reality, they have shrunken considerably. Once you finish school, you might have enough for rent and a student loan payment, but beyond that, not much. This article should help you begin your pursuit of financial freedom.

## Save All Your Money

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are so many activities you can do that will incur a cost. Think about it – going out for coffee? Food? Drinks? Groceries? Subscriptions? Game day is also a time that you will probably spend money on food. If you're happy to spend that money, do so, but just don't get so lost in the costs of it that you can't avoid them.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

For example, buying groceries is easy. A loaf of bread, a bag of apples and a jar of peanut butter shouldn't be too difficult. Even if you have a tight budget and have to choose between it or gas to go visit a friend, choose groceries.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can save money on non-essential items by putting your purchases on a coupon saving site. Grocery stores often have coupons that you can print out and use right there in the store.

<!--EndFragment-->

## Set Your Goals

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your goals can make all the difference in your finances. This means looking at what your basic necessities are, then work backwards. Ask yourself what you need to get by in order to maintain this lifestyle.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You might consider a few categories. First, you need transportation. For most people, this will be their car. You can save money on your rent or mortgage by not driving your car. You can also get by with walking.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

After your car, you need to have a place to live. This is where your home can be a big savings. You can find excellent and affordable apartments in a variety of cities online, or check out government housing options. Or you could just buy a home. When in doubt, take a look at what the current market is asking for homes around your area.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Once you’ve got all this figured out, you need some toys. You’ll need a television, and maybe a laptop and a cell phone.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Consider Alternative Means of Transportation

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Depending on where you live and what transportation options are available, your decision might need to be made before you decide on an apartment. If you live in a metropolitan area and your local bus doesn't reach your work, you may need to take a cab. Or if you're in a smaller town, it might be cheaper for you to just drive a car.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Minimize Your Housing Costs

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This might sound a bit ridiculous, but we are living in a world where real estate is getting cheaper and cheaper. So are rent and mortgage payments. They’re the types of expenses that we all love to budget for, but also know we won't be able to avoid. But for better or worse, they're unavoidable.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can get lucky and find a great place to live, but they’re not something to be taken for granted. You might need to get a roommate or rent something in a less expensive area to save money on housing. Or you might have to move to a cheaper city, like Chicago. When in doubt, rent or mortgage or just take a look at the latest cost of living surveys.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Cut Costs on Bills

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is another area that needs a little set up, but it's an important part of being financially free. As you set goals, you need to look for ways to cut your bills. That means look at your bills, figure out what you pay, and figure out what you actually use.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

How much water do you use? How much is your electric bill? How much are your cell phone bills? Even if you don't get much in the way of international calls, you can save a few dollars on your phone bill by getting a local prepaid phone.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Spend Smart

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your end goal should always be to spend less, but there are times when you should spend more. This includes things like new clothes, new shoes, or even furniture. While there are no rules for how much money you should spend on new items, spending more often can be a wise choice.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Your goal should be to save money, not to spend as much money as you can on items that aren't important to your lifestyle. Look at a brand new luxury car like a Maserati and see if it makes sense in your financial situation. If it does, you might consider buying it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Pay Off Your Debt

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is especially important if you're living at home, and in the unfortunate circumstance of going through a divorce. This is particularly good for saving money when it comes to a co-signed loan or home equity line of credit that may have equity. These loans have an easy way to pay them off early with little to no penalties.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Before you even consider building up more debt, take care of that stuff. No one is going to charge you a premium for paying early. Then, even if you can't pay off that debt as fast as you'd like, you will have saved up money that you can use to improve your lifestyle.

## Frugal Living

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

While this may seem pretty obvious, you wouldn't believe how many people have way more money than they could ever imagine. The most obvious example would be me. If you can imagine the amount of money I have in my bank account, you would probably assume I was filthy rich.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is not the case. I have never made an hourly wage. I have a degree, so I have more schooling than most, but that's not the kind of schooling that will pay your bills. I am surrounded by smart, beautiful, generous people who help me out when they can. In reality, I live a very simple life – a single guy living in a small apartment in college town.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I spend less than a thousand dollars a month on rent and utilities, which is $200 less than the national average. I spend $100 on food per week, which is one of the lower averages for people living on their own.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This means that I work only two jobs, two to three times a week. My days are filled with classes, work, eating, sleeping, and lots of walking. Yes, it's tiring, but I'm able to make my rent and bills, so I am able to save money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

My food costs are also low – $40-50 a month for groceries. That means I can eat just about anything, for any meal. There is no sitting around in a restaurant and eating at ridiculous prices – I get a good amount of food for my money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Live A Simple Lifestyle

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

One of the things that makes me so frugal is my living situation. The only things I get to do with my money is save it.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you can figure out a way to live a low-stress life where you have money to put aside and can work on things without having to be bothered by them, you will be able to save more money. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Create Your Own Money

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Some people aren't very creative with their money, and that's alright. Personally, I have a friend who makes the same amount of money that I do, but he saves more. This friend doesn't have his own apartment, and his clothes and shoes are older than mine.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

His debt to income ratio is much lower, so he is able to save more. If you're happy with the money you make, then I would stay there. But if you are not doing what you love, and you want to live your life doing something you're really passionate about, then I suggest you start creating your own money.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It might mean taking a pay cut in the short term, but in the long term, you'll be able to live the life you want.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Live Your Life Out Loud

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This isn't just for artists. A lot of the smartest, most successful people make it a habit to live their lives in an adventurous way. Warren Buffett, who has an estimated net worth of over $50 billion, has  cruised his boat on the Hudson River, even though he has a private jet.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Steve Jobs, who invented the most successful piece of technology the world has ever known, started every day drinking coffee with strangers on the streets of Palo Alto.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Have you ever heard of The Secret? It's about how things that are worth having and achieving come to those who create them. All of the most successful people I know are very passionate about what they do, and they refuse to live lives that just get by. They create the money for themselves.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Instead of settling for the life that your parents live, make your own. You can make a lot of money at what you love, and make sure that you're always happy with the money you earn.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Embrace Financial Independence

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Money isn't everything, but it sure helps. It's important to make money on the side, but you should also make your money work for you.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I find that financial independence means something a little different for different people. Some people choose to make their money work for them, but they don't have other sources of income.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This could mean not having a job, or investing a portion of your income into something that they're passionate about, like an online business or writing.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It can also mean earning enough income to live in a different country. I think of financial independence as the ability to do whatever you want with your money – it can be anything, even traveling around the world on a whim.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Whatever your definition of financial independence, it will be a way for you to make your money work for you and do the things you love.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I have to admit that while these habits are important for financial independence, I don't really see a huge difference in my life between having a decent amount of money and being completely debt free.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you have something to sell, or a skill that you're proud of, why wouldn't you make your money work for you?
