## What is a Dropshipping Business?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You may have never heard the term before. So let me give you a brief introduction.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Dropshipping is a subsector of eCommerce in which you purchase items directly from manufacturers and have them shipped directly to customers. Instead of going through a store or a website to buy your products, you go to an online marketplace and browse through many options, including both international and local vendors. Then you sell them in your own store or online store.

For this type of business model, you're not selling actual goods but "facilitating" other people's sales, similar to an accountant or a graphic designer. For instance, you may have products that you're selling on a market place, where the seller is picking them up at their warehouse in their city. They don't necessarily know where they're getting the products, who's producing them, and so on. They just put them in their order and the rest is out of their hands.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The same concept applies for dropshippers. However, instead of handing over the merchandise at the retailer's doorstep, you are the ones ordering the merchandise directly from the manufacturer. You order the merchandise for the retailer. Once the products are received, they deliver it to your customer. You get a percentage of the retailer's sale and not the entire sale because you don't actually sell the product.

<!--StartFragment-->

Dropshipping is a pretty long and involved process. To begin, you need to be familiar with the product. Then you need to determine which products you can sell on the market place.

## Where Can I Find a Dropshipping Business Idea?

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

In the last year, there’s been a huge amount of businesses popping up with dropshipping service. And a handful of businesses are doing very well.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But the idea of running a dropshipping business isn’t one that just sprouts overnight. If you’re looking for a fresh start, you should look for an existing business with a big enough target audience.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The most popular categories to drop ship are clothing, footwear, and accessories. The site Ebay is considered a very good place to drop ship because there are millions of items from hundreds of different vendors on there.

<!--StartFragment-->

A general rule of thumb is the more specific the idea is, the more successful your dropshipping business will be.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

But before you buy anything, you should ask yourself some questions:

One thing to note before you start making any big purchases, is that you need to work out if you can actually run a dropshipping business.

You don’t want to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars, only to discover that it’s too hard. If you don’t know what you’re getting into, you could end up with a $10,000 business that you never make a dime from.

Before you start on your store, make sure you know what you are getting into. Duties, insurance, taxes and so on, will all affect how your store performs. Shopify offers guides, detailed procedures and checklists for the respective issues.

Shopify on the other hand is built specifically for merchants, meaning that you have to spend a lot more time with the platform in order to make it work and you have to spend more money in order to upgrade to a higher level.
