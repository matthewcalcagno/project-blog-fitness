There are hundreds of ways to earn money online. I’m not going to list them all here, as every business model is completely different. Instead, here are some common ways people make money online, and what to keep in mind as you pursue these opportunities.

## Start Dropshipping

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Drop shipping is the process of buying directly from a company, then selling the product through your own website or a marketplace. You can drop ship products directly from the manufacturer, or from brands or sellers on Amazon.com.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

How do you make money? Simple. Sell the items you buy on Amazon a little higher than the price you paid for through your own website, or a marketplace like Ebay.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are plenty of places online where you can set up a drop ship business. The two most popular ones are Shopify and Wordpress using Woocommerce.

## Sell eBooks

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Yes, there are still thousands of people willing to pay to read a new eBook in 2021, just like there are thousands of people willing to pay to buy a new physical book.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can start selling eBooks for as little as $10, and there’s no limit to the number you can sell.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Even if you don’t have a website, you can create an eBook for Kindle, and sell it to Amazon’s Kindle store, as well as many other online retailers, including Barnes and Noble, Apple’s iBookstore, Kobo, or any of the dozens of international stores.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can also sell Kindle eBooks directly to people who aren’t Kindle readers. Just head over to one of Amazon’s main Kindle sites, and create an ebook that’s a stand alone ebook, or a preview of a book you’re writing.

## Try Print on Demand

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Print on demand is proving to be a popular option to make money online. People are making a lot of money selling their designs on clothing.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are websites out there where people can sell their designs. The most popular one is Redbubble. Redbubble is one of the most popular platforms to sell your designs and there are a lot of them.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

There are lots of thousands of people selling designs on Redbubble.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Whether you want to create a t-shirt or a coffee mug, Redbubble is the place to be. You can create a profile and list your items on their website. It is really easy to use and very user-friendly.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Redbubble has a lot of different options you can use. For example, you can create t-shirt templates. You can make t-shirt labels, you can make freebie designs, you can do button designs, there are so many different options.

## Freelance

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Become a freelancer. The money will be better but you’ll be much more stressed out.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Kinda hard to find a job right now so I highly recommend freelancing. Not as easy as people make it sound but it is possible. I think it’s a better career choice for ‘amateurs’ as it’s flexible and you can take on projects and make a lot of money but you’ll have to hustle hard.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

My favorite part of freelancing is the flexibility. I love how you’re allowed to do whatever you want as long as you fulfill certain criteria, it’s a lot more fun working in a team, or in a company, but freelancing is definitely the better choice in terms of lifestyle. Plus the money can be nice too. The money will be better if you’re younger and don’t have children to support, but it’s worth a try.

## Make an App

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

A good way to make a lot of money from home for free is to make an app.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

You can make money from an app that works on many phones. Make it free and earn money from ads or charge for it. You can also create apps for specific products and services.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This way, you can make money while you do other things. You can use it to build a brand. A brand that people would want to pay money for.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It’s also a good way to stay in touch with customers who may be interested in what you do. As you get more experience, you’ll be able to add even more features to your app and make it better.

<!--EndFragment-->

## Start a blog

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Make money blogging is not an easy task. But with a great blog idea and good strategies, anyone can do it. You will need to work hard and do the things that you are good at, but you will end up winning more money than you can imagine.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Moreover, you can start a blog on almost any subject. You can blog about events and new products. You can create a blog about financial tips, investing strategy, and anything that you are an expert about. It all depends on your own creativity.

## Create a course

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

If you want to make passive income for a long time then you should look into creating an online course.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Everyone is ready to pay money when it is related to something they are interested in. This means you can create an online course that teaches other people what you know. Then, you will make money when they take action on your course.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

This is an incredibly lucrative business because you can create multiple course, offer them for sale and make money from every single one of them.

<!--EndFragment-->



<!--StartFragment-->

## Become a Streamer

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

It’s easy to get into but you will have to put a lot of time into it. You’ll get some viewers, you’ll get some friends, but it’s not like a traditional TV job where you can just do the work when it’s convenient for you. It’s online 24/7 so you’ll have to be willing to put in the work.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Streamers make a lot of money because there are a lot of customers who want to watch them play. But you will not just get rich doing it. Twitch is mostly about building an audience and if you want to make it big, you will have to invest a lot of time into it.
